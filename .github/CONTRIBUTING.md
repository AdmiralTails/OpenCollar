OpenCollar needs your help!

For small, obvious bug fixes, just fork our repo, make the fix on your fork, and
send us a pull request.  We'll try to review it promptly.

For big changes or new features, please open a ticket first where we can discuss
the change.  We wouldn't want you to put a ton of time into something and then only
find out at the end that we'd need big changes before being able to accept it.
